[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/Georacer/last_letter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/Georacer/last_letter?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

"last_letter" is a collection of [ROS](http://ros.org/) packages suitable for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle research, control algorithm development, non-linear physics simulation, Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) simulation and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) simulation. It is developed by George Zogopoulos Papaliakos.
This document serves as a manual for this congregation of ROS packages.

## Compatibility

This collection of packages is being developed and used under Linux Ubuntu 12.04 using ROS Hydro.

## Installation

Just clone the root of this repo to your catkin workspace. Each of the package folders should be under your .../ROS/catkin_ws/src directory.

## Packages

### last_letter

This is the core package, containing the physics and kinematics simulator and controller nodes.

## How to Run

The last_letter/launch file contains a few template .launch files which can be used to raise multiple nodes while reading from several parameter files of your choice. Consult them in order to build your own .launch files. The proposed structure is to split the simulation and visualization launch files, since these two functions are functionally independent anyway.

### RC Simulator

For this scenario, you will need to have a joystick (or similar device visible to the "joy" ROS package) plugged in to your machine. You may need to configure the /dev/input/js* parameter to point to your controller. Running roslaunch last_letter launcher_ll.launch will start the simulator running the "last_letter" standard aircraft, visible in the rviz visualizer, under direct, manual user control. It will also open the "rqt_dashboard" plugin for rqt_gui, which contains virtual flight instruments.
